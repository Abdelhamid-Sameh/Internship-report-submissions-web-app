*Steps for  finding and completing an internship*
1- Companies inform SCAD of internship opportunities, where internships offered can
have a duration that starts with one month and extends until 6 months. Internships
can be paid or unpaid.

2- Students need to navigate announcements made by companies recruiting interns
until they find a suitable opportunity and apply for it.

3- Companies during the filtration process typically check CVs and conduct interviews
before they offer internships to candidate students.

4- If accepted, students proceed with their intern jobs until they conclude the tasks
required.

5- After the internship is successfully done, there are two types of evaluations that
take place.
          
    - Companies evaluate the intern across several metrics and dimensions, and the
      intern evaluates the company in a free form feedback text.

          
    - Students can recommend the company to other interns, and they are required
      to provide input on the faculty courses that helped them the most during the
      internship.

6- The intern is then required to create a report designed by SCAD. The report has
sections that provide an overview of the company’s business and market stand, the
tasks performed by the intern, and the feedback about the company’s work environment 
and the helpful courses, together with the student’s recommendation.
